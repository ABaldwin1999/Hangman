# The Hangman
https://abaldwin1999.github.io/Hangman/

A game of reverse Hangman with six rounds to play and three endings. Built using JavaScript programming techniques and DOM manipulation.


Press the buttons to guess letters, losing all lives results in a game over. Guessing every word correctly for all six rounds tarnishes your soul. Lose a round and you will be unemployed. Playing the game without guessing a single correct letter gives you a moral victory.
