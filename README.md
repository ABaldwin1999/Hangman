# The Hangman

A game of Hangman with six rounds to play and three endings.

Press the buttons to guess letters, losing all lives results in a game over.

When the buttons are clicked a check is performed to see if the guess is correct functions are called to check if the round is won, lost or still ongoing.

Two bugs known: the function getChances which should decrease the chances given as the game progresses does not reduce the number of chances given. Second ending not generated.
